## Overview
This demonstration integrates several tools and technologies to showcase the power and flexibility of GitOps in a modern infrastructure:

### Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM):
- RHACM is a comprehensive cluster management solution from Red Hat, designed to simplify the life-cycle of Kubernetes clusters, from creation to management and application deployment.
- Role in this project: RHACM will oversee and manage the Kubernetes clusters, ensuring they're compliant with defined policies, and helping in scaling, upgrading, or recovering clusters as necessary.

### Assisted Installer:
- An innovative deployment tool crafted for OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) clusters. It streamlines the process of setting up a Kubernetes cluster, especially on challenging environments like bare metal.
- Role in this project: We'll use Assisted Installer to deploy OCP onto our emulated bare metal environment. It'll interact with the emulated Redfish API, believing it's deploying to genuine bare metal servers.

### KVM & Sushy-Tools:
- KVM stands for Kernel-based Virtual Machine, a virtualization technology built into the Linux kernel. Sushy-Tools, on the other hand, simulates a Redfish API for systems that lack genuine Redfish support, like our KVM virtual machines.
- Role in this project: KVM creates the foundational virtual infrastructure for our demonstration. Sushy-Tools will act as a translator, making these VMs appear as Redfish compliant bare metal machines. This illusion allows Assisted Installer to deploy OCP clusters as if it's a true bare metal environment.

### Red Hat GitOps & Tekton Pipelines:
- Red Hat GitOps is a solution that enforces infrastructure and application configurations to be defined and stored in a Git repository. Tekton Pipelines is a powerful Kubernetes-native CI/CD solution that can be used to deploy and manage applications and infrastructure.
- Role in this project: With the GitOps principle, any change to our infrastructure or application state will start as a change in our Git repository. Tekton Pipelines will continuously ensure that our live environment matches this desired state, making the infrastructure-as-code paradigm a reality.
